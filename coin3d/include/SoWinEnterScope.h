// This is just a dummy file to be sourcecode compatible with TGS'
// Inventor on MSWindows platforms. They use this header file to set
// up the __declspec(dllimport) define for application programs to
// properly import the DLL's API.
//
// This is not such a good idea, as __declspec(dllimport) should only
// conditionally be defined when the application programmer is using
// the Coin library as a DLL, and not when using it as a static
// library.
//
// When compiling application code against Coin and linking with a
// Coin dynamic library (.dll), you need to add the define "COIN_DLL"
// to the preprocessor / compiler.
